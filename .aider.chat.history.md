#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo image to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A vibrant logo featuring a stylized musical note intertwined with a cloud shape, set against a gradient of deep blue to teal, symbolizing music streaming and sharing. The note is rendered in white with subtle shadow, and the cloud has a subtle glow. The background is a smooth gradient from dark navy at the top to light sky blue at the bottom, giving a modern, dynamic feel.
